This is the final project of 1st semester in Python. The aim of this course was to provide us the fundamental Python programming concepts techniques and methods in OOP and more, in order to provide us the necessary techniques that a data scientist needs to know in Python environment.

This project is part of this course. I chose this topic by myself, builting it from scratch.
It's an imaginary e-shop where the "customer" can do a variety of actions within it like:

1. Purchases (Add-Remove products to his shopping cart: each product is deducted from the stock if it is added to the shopping cart)
2. See the whole available inventory and be able to search a specific product (having implemented sorting algorithm)
3. To apply the discount code which is given as a message
4. To checkout
5. To go to his shopping cart

While on the other hand "admin" can also enter to make his own changes to his online store (code for having access is "GiorgosTzimas"):
1. Add/Remove products from the store and
2. Update price, size, stock from existing products
